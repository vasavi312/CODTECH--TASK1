## PROGRAM FOR: SIMPLE CALCULATOR ##

# Objective #

Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.

# Advanced Calculator

This Python program implements an advanced calculator with basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# KEY ACTIVITIES #

- Input Collection:
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2) as input.
It also asks the user to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).<br>
- Operations:
The program defines four functions for different mathematical operations:
add(x, y): Adds two numbers.
subtract(x, y): Subtracts the second number from the first.
multiply(x, y): Multiplies the two numbers.
divide(x, y): Divides the first number by the second (handles division by zero).<br>
- User Choice:
Based on the user’s input (choice), the program performs the selected operation.<br>
- Output Display:
The program displays the result of the chosen operation.

## How to Use

-  Enter two numbers when prompted.
-  Select an operation ((+) for addition, (-) for subtraction, (*) for multiplication, or (/) for division).
-  The program will display the result.

# Advanced Calculator Project Conclusion
###   1.Objective:    
* The goal of this project was to create a Python-based calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>
###   2.Features Implemented:
* The program collects two numbers from the user.
* It prompts the user to select an operation.
* Based on the user’s choice, it performs the corresponding calculation.
* Error handling prevents division by zero.<br>
###   3.Technologies Used:
* Python: The primary programming language.
* Functions: Modularized code for each operation.
* Input/Output (I/O): User input and result display.
  * Conditional Statements: Decision-making based on user choice.
  * Floating-Point Arithmetic: Handling decimal values.<br>
###   4.Next Steps:
  *You can enhance the calculator by adding more features:*
  * Support for additional mathematical functions (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
  * A user-friendly menu system.
  * Error handling for invalid inputs.
  * Unit tests to verify correctness.
  * A graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter.<br>
###   5.Acknowledgments:
